# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The code needs to be tested to ensure the program is functioning correctly. A developer needs to test for possible bad input either by users or by functions making a change to data. Any area that data is required to be a certain type, length, or only accepts specific chunks of numbers should be tested. Integration within functions, methods, classes, and programs should be checked to ensure stability within the systems and everything is functioning as expected.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can include exactly what it is, their needs. A user may need to be able to update certain data variables or be allowed to input new data. That need is then interpreted and used to write code to fulfill that need. This code then needs to be tested to ensure functionality and then the program needs to be tested to ensure nothing was broken in the process of adding this new function to fulfill the need. 

# How do I approach designing software?
Software design needs to start with planning and design. What the program's overall goal is, what functionality is needed to achieve this goal, and what other functionality is wanted are some of the things that need to be thought about during planning. The simple way or taking a short cut should be avoided, these can lead to problems down the line. Test cases should begin as soon as program requirements have been determined. This allows for testing to start as soon as a function is finished and can make sure there is no wasted time. Any defects found should be fixed sooner rather than later as defects can pile up and compile to create larger defects.
